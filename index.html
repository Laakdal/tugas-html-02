                        <p>Microsoft Flight Simulator is a flight simulation program for Microsoft Windows, marketed as a Video Games game and run on a Windows system. This game is one of the oldest and most sophisticated games used as a home simulation program of the many available in the market. Microsoft Flight Simulator is the first product in the Microsoft portfolio - different from most other business-oriented software - and the longest running, surpassing Windows by three years. Bruce Artwick created the Flight Simulator program in 1977 and his company subLOGIC sells it for a wide variety of personal computers. In 1982, the Artwick company licensed Microsoft a version of Flight Simulator for the IBM PC, which was marketed as Microsoft Flight Simulator 1.00. Microsoft CEO Bill Gates was intrigued by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's "Night Flight," because it clearly feels like flying a small plane.</p>
